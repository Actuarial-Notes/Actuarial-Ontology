# Actuarial Ontology
Welcome! This is the home of an open source ontology for the domain of actuarial science.

> An **ontology** is a formal language that describes concepts and relationships within a domain of knowledge.

> **Actuarial science** is a discipline that quantifies risk and makes decisions about the redistribution of risk among groups.

## Why create an Ontology?
Actuarial science has a lot of domain specific terminology. However, there is no general structure that bridges the language used by actuaries to other contexts.

While [actuarial standards](http://www.actuarialstandardsboard.org/standards-of-practice/) provide definitions, the meaning of words can still differ between contexts of practice area or product. Additionally, other professions or disciplines may use the same word with a different meaning that's specific to their domain.

The existence of an actuarial ontology has 3 expected benefits:
1. Improve communication of actuarial concepts between actuaries and other agents.
2. Use to build models or software that can perform actuarial tasks.
3. Use to build artificial agents that can effectively communicate with actuaries and perform generic actuarial tasks.
